# Figura-bug-scare-system
===

This script adds dynamic fear reactions to your Figura avatar when spiders or silverfish are nearby. When hostile insects approach within 4 blocks, your avatar will:

    Switch to a terrified facial expression

    Play a panic animation sequence

    Maintain a cowering pose until the threat leaves

    Smoothly transition back to normal afterward
